    <h1>This is a project for my matura exam</h1>
    <p>I started this project with the idea of creating a web application, where you could upload the cars you whant to rent to other people and see which cars are uploaded
        from other users. I think I have achived this goal and on the end my website came together quite nicely. Building this webapp took me quite some time because
        I was new to Yii2 and did not have a lot of experience with php. But after building this project I became quite confident in building web apps with php and Yii2.
        I used other tools like ajax, pjax and some other too.
